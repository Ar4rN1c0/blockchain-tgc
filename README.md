# Boring code explanations

The app is built with NextJS, a framework commonly used in order to build fullstack applications. This version of the project is developed using NextJS 13.5.4.

## Running the application

In order to run the application in your computer (as a developer mode) you will need the latest version of NodeJS and NPM.

1. First, clone the repository to your work environment: 
    `git clone https://github.com/Ar4rN1c0/blockchain-tgc.git`
2. Second, install all the libraries by running:
    `npm install`
3. Thirdly, run the app with the command:
    `npm run dev`
    This will run the developer mode and generate a local server. The server and the browser will automatically refresh when you save your changed files.

## Modifying the application

If you want to change something, first you need to understand how the app works, here is a quick explanation.

### The internal work.



### How to change how the app works. 

### The transactions provider.

### How to change how the app looks like

If you are fine with the working of the application, but perhaps the design is not the best to you, go to the directory `src/styles`. There you will find a bunch of CSS files (if you do not know how to use CSS, please go and watch some of the thousands of tutorials on YouTube), but not the regular ones. This project is built with CSSModules, so you should check on that aswell.

You can see which classes correspond with each element navigating the code.
